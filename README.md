Tradepally Debts Credits API Usage Example

This illustrates minimal usage of a Debts & Credits Recording module, which is part of my larger bookkeeping app, Tradepally.com.

I recently exposed the module for use in another private project via an API and decided to put up a glympse here.

The module's full functionality includes more indebt operations, like: linking debtor to creditor and vice versa, and linking either of them to other users on the platform who can assent to txns meant for them - thereby adding a layer of legitimacy, among other features.
